# travel-log
Keep track of places you've been, places you'd like to go, and places you'd rather avoid

## Purpose

The aim of this project is to build out a working Travel Log application. Work on this project provides opportunities for those looking to build their confidence working with code through structured tasks, pair programming or independent work.

In order to ensure the best experience for those new to development, I will be keeping the contributor pool small. If you are interested, please get in touch and we can see what is possible.
